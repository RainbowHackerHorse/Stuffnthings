# Stuff n things
Random Stuff and Things. Mainly Scripts

All scripts are released under a 2-clause BSD license.
They come with no warranty. It is not my fault if they accidentally all your everything.

Repo info:

slackattack.sh - Turns Linode's Slackware 14.1 Default Install into a complete (sans X11 stuff) install
fishroot.sh - alters the home folder dataset on ZFS so fish prints ~ instead of /usr/home/$username 
Linodebackup.sh - Backups script for remote backups. Run it from Rescue Mode
