# Modified version of PÃ¼r Linux portsnag utility for Cygwin on Windows
# Conceptually based on portsnap, from FreeBSD. 
# No portsnap code is contained in portsnag.
# I'm not awesome enough to successfully rip off Best OS.
# This script relies on CVS to do the heavy lifting, rather than portsnap's
# inbuilt goodness.
# Make sure you install GCC or Clang, and CVS as part of your cygwin setup
